name: endrium
description: advanced material used in walls and heat protection
cost: 15
radioactivity: 3
color: c093fa
research: surge-alloy
hardness: 15
details: one of the most durable materials ever, getting its durability from melting thorium and silvus down with so much heat that their basic atomic particles spill out and reorganize themselves into endrium. a theoretical super material that can withstand the internals of a star has the same process to create, but requires qaudrillions times more heat to produce
